# Game of Life

## Goal 
The goal of this project is to create a simple replica of conways game of life
with different rules and different starting positions.

## MVP
The MVP will be to create a 2D game of life with at least 3 different (what I will
call interesting) rules and 3 different starting positions. I wish to make each of
these easily interchangable using some sort of config or ini file so that I can 
mess around with things easily.

The MVP will include a live visualization using a library within python (likely pygame)

## Stretch Goals
Extend the game of life to a 3D game of life and visualize it using slices.
Maybe visualize it using some color gradient as well: eg use a slice from each angle of 
the cube and add up the amount of black cells in a column and set its color value based
on that. Learn to code time sensitive ciritical code in c or c++ and the main code in python.
Learn to create a make file and a shared library.

## Learning goals
Learn to implement and use a visualization library. 
Learn to optimize a simulation (probably using bit manipulation).
Learn to create an ini file or config file.
